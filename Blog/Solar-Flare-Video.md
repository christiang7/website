The video shows the amazing creation of a solar flare in 2011. The researchers analyzed the emergence of solar winds during solar eclipses over 12 years. It gives us better insides of how they formed and the processes in the corona of the sun. Also it can be used for betters predictions of solar winds for space weather on Earth.
